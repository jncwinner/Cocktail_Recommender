to actually pour these drinks, the secret is to pour very slowly, barely dribble the liqueurs into your glass. start with your first liqueur and pour it into your glass, now take your spoon and place the tip of the spoon very close to your first liqueur, now carefully and slowly pour in your second liqueur over the back of the spoon and into the glass, then your third. repeat this step as many times as necessary to complete your drink. after a little practice you can generally do away with the spoon and will be able to pour a slow steady stream, and keep your liqueurs from mixing.","['baileys irish cream', 'green creme de menthe', 'grand marnier', 'kahlua']",4

the sumptuous combination of fine quality cognac, rich brown coffee and dramatic blue flames provides a memorable end to a special evening.
whether you be celebrating christmas, new year, easter or something more personal such as a birthday, anniversary or simply a special dinner, a brulot charentais can brighten up the occasion and turn it into something special. history of brulot charentais: brulot charentais is 3 centuries old! in times gone by, most people used to take a hot drink or infusion, before going to bed. in the cognac area, many opted for a wine topped off with burning alcohol, which had the effect of producing 'mulled' wine. the flames symbolised 'festivity' either during or after a meal. for special occasions - baptisms, communions, marriages, birthdays, christmas, easter and the like, the charentais wine farmers, would add a slug of neat cognac, straight from the cask, to the surface. this cognac, strong in alcohol, was set alight, reducing its strength and producing striking blue flames. thus brulot charentais was born. the sugar in the saucer would soak up any 'stray drops' of cognac which also combusted, and blended together, formed a liqueur rich in cognac flavours. the coffee’s taste was transformed by combining with the sugar and cognac. the coffee reaches drinking temperature due to the combustion. the recipe preserves the aroma and flavour of the cognac, whilst reducing the strength (down to about 2 - 3 percent). make your 'soirées' more festive with a cup of flaming brulot charentais! the recipe ingredients are for one person - please increase the quantities as necessary.
why not end your celebration the charentais way?","['brewed coffee', 'cognac', 'lumps of sugar']",3

so yummy and dangerous!!!!
i asked 2 different bar tenders to make this drink for me. one at applebees and the other at catch 22 both in nj. the applebees bartender at first said he didn't have the ingredients but then he i told him he had apple schnapps, vanilla vodka and buttershots schnapps he went and made better then i did. he swirled caramel on the inside of the glass his own doing (can you believe i didn't have to tell him to do that) and dipped the rim into cinnamon and sugar my telling him. he had no problem making this drink for me and invited my husband and i back on the nights he works. the bartender at catch 22  didn't like making something new at first but he came accustom very fast when everyone was trying my drink and going up and asking him for one.($8.00 a drink he was charging). he made out on me!

a history of pimms:
step back to a london oyster bar in the 1840s where owner james pimm invented the thirst-quencher. using gin, quinine and a secret mixture of herbs, good old pimm served up the brew as an aid to digestion, dishing it out in a small tankard and the no. 1 cup moniker was born.

after the second world war, pimms extended their range, using a number of other spirits as bases for new cups. scotch lent its name to no. 2 cup, whilst no. 3 used brandy, no. 4 rum, no. 5 rye and no. 6 vodka. of all of these, the vodka cup is the only one in production along with the original no. 1 cup, which still reigns supreme in popularity. cheers!","[""pimm's liqueur"", 'lemonade', 'orange', 'lemon', 'apple', 'cucumber', 'of fresh mint', 'strawberry']",8

frank cisneros says this is probably the most popular cocktail he's ever made; it was on the menu at gin palace in new york's east village for years. upon first taste, you'll see why it was such a crowd-pleaser. it's a sunny, warming drink, thanks to pineapple's heady tropical flavor and a spicy cinnamon simple syrup, all perked up with grapefruit, lime, and piney gin. 
 -- 
there's no need to get out a juicer for this; just muddle a 2- to 3-inch chunk of fresh pineapple and strain through a fine-mesh strainer into your measuring cup or jigger. this drink would be totally at home at a tiki party; you can multiply the recipe (and make fresh pineapple juice by whirring chopped fruit in your blender, then straining), but don't try to shake more than two drinks at a time.","['gin', 'cinnamon syrup', 'fresh pineapple juice', 'fresh lime juice', 'grapefruit juice', 'water', 'sugar', 'cinnamon sticks']",8

i adore this fragrant and refreshing strawberry-gin drink, created by shannon tebay sidle of new york's slowly shirley and death & co. the secret ingredient is a dollop of unsweetened greek yogurt, which gives the cocktail a tangy flavor and subtly creamy texture. the final result isn't sweet or smoothie-like; this is definitely still a cocktail. a sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper highlights the gin's herbal character, but i also like this drink with grassy blanco tequila or a full-bodied aged rum. if your fridge doesn't dispense crushed ice, fill a freezer bag with cubes, wrap them in a dish towel, and go wild with a meat tenderizer or rolling pin.","['strawberries', 'honey', 'gin', 'greek yogurt', 'fresh ground black pepper', 'strawberry']",6

history:  from 1939 to 1945 joseph sheridan was the head chef of a catering company based at the shannon airport (20 miles north of limerick , ireland ). joseph sheridan was taxed with trying to find a suitable drink for passengers who had traveled for eighteen hours by seaplane and then had to travel by boat to the terminal. hot coffee and tea was obviously not enough to take the chill out of the passengers so joseph began to offer an alternative. his mix of irish whiskey and coffee became known as irish coffee, and joseph had secured his place in drink history

to this day if you travel through shannon airport you will find the “sheridan bar” in the departures lounge, and a plaque that has been placed there in honour of joseph’s great warm libation.

one of the key, and often overlooked ingredients in this drink is benedictine. while the resulting flavour is not overly predominate, it does add a certain taste profile that would be totally missing without this secret ingredient.

none dispute that the singapore sling was originally created by mr. ngiam tong boon for the raffles hotel in singapore. however that is where the agreements end. the exact date is in question, with some people claiming it was in 1915, some 1913, while the hotel itself claims that it was created sometime prior to 1910. there is also plenty of disagreement as to how closely the current version of this drink that is served at raffles is to what was originally served. apparently the original recipe was lost and forgotten sometime in the 1930's, and the drink that they currently serve at the hotel's long bar (see recipe below) is based on memories of former bartenders, and some written notes that they were able to discover. whatever the truth may be, this ""iconic"" drink is still enjoyed today, as much as it was back in the early 20th century! maybe, the only way to really appreciate this cocktail, is to sip it slowly whilst sitting in a rattan chair, under the ceiling fans in the long bar at raffles hotel!","['gin', 'cherry heering', 'cointreau liqueur', 'benedictine', 'pineapple juice', 'lime juice', 'grenadine', 'bitters']",8
